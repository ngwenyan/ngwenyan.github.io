    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a 17-year old student from <a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">Dunman High School</a>, Singapore, and I have two wonderful brothers.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I am interested in music. I enjoy playing the piano. Apart from music, I also love learning about the natural processes of the world. As such, my favourite subjects apart from music are Geography and Biology, though I do not take these subjects. In terms of sports, skateboarding, swimming and hiking are among my favourites.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>I am participating in SYF with the Senior High String Ensemble this year. Other projects are mostly music related as well!</p>
